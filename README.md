# LAB1 : Arabic Web Scraping and NLP Pipeline

## Overview

This project focuses on scraping Arabic news articles from the Al Jazeera website and implementing a Natural Language Processing (NLP) pipeline to process the content. The primary objective is to extract valuable insights from the articles for analysis or other applications.

## Web Scraping Pipeline

### Step 1: Data Collection

In this phase, we develop functionality to extract articles from the Al Jazeera News website. We implement pagination to access multiple pages of articles and utilize Selenium WebDriver to click the 'See More' button and retrieve additional content.

### Step 2: Data Storage

After scraping the article content, we store it in MongoDB for further processing and analysis. MongoDB provides a flexible and scalable solution for managing our data, allowing us to store articles in a structured format for easy retrieval and analysis.

## NLP Pipeline

### Step 3: Text Preprocessing

1. **Text Cleaning**: Remove non-Arabic characters from the article content to ensure consistency and accuracy in subsequent processing steps.

2. **Tokenization**: Split the article content into individual sentences using tokenization. This step is essential for breaking down the text into smaller units for further analysis.

3. **Stop Word Removal**: Remove common stop words from the tokenized sentences to eliminate noise and improve the quality of the data.

### Step 4: Feature Extraction

1. **Stemming and Lemmatization**: Reduce words to their root forms using stemming and lemmatization techniques. This helps standardize the text and improve the efficiency of downstream NLP tasks. For lemmatization, we utilized the Stanza package, which offers robust support for various languages, including Arabic. Stanza's lemmatization feature leverages neural network-based approaches to accurately determine the base forms of words, considering factors such as part of speech, context, and morphology. By using Stanza for lemmatization, we ensure accurate and context-aware word normalization, which is crucial for tasks such as text analysis, information retrieval, and machine learning.

   For instance, the word "الإيرانية" (meaning "Iranian" in English) stemmed to "يرن" by ISRIStemmer of nltk package, which doesn't fully capture its original meaning or form.
### Step 5: Analysis

1. **Part-Of-Speech (POS) Tagging**: Assign a part-of-speech tag to each word in the text to identify its grammatical category and role within the sentence. This information is valuable for tasks such as syntactic analysis and information extraction.

2. **Named Entity Recognition (NER) Tagging**: Identify and classify named entities in the text, such as persons, organizations, and locations. NER tagging helps extract meaningful information and entities from the text for further analysis.

### Step 6: Insights Generation

Once the text has been preprocessed and analyzed, we can generate insights from the data for various applications. This may include sentiment analysis, topic modeling, entity extraction, and more, depending on the specific goals of the project.

## Conclusion

Through this Lab, we gain practical experience in web scraping, data preprocessing, and NLP techniques for Arabic text. By implementing a structured pipeline, we can efficiently collect, process, and analyze large volumes of text data to extract valuable insights and drive decision-making. 

Additionally, we concluded that the **NLTK** package is not as powerful for handling Arabic text due to its rule-based approach. While NLTK provides basic functionality for tasks such as tokenization and POS tagging, its effectiveness is limited when dealing with the complexities of Arabic morphology and syntax. 

In contrast, tools like **Stanza** offer more advanced capabilities for Arabic NLP tasks, leveraging neural network-based models to achieve higher accuracy and robustness. Stanza's use of neural networks allows it to effectively capture the intricate linguistic features of Arabic, making it a preferred choice for tasks such as lemmatization, POS tagging, and NER tagging.
